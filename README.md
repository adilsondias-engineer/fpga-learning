# FPGA Learning for Trading Systems

A hands-on journey learning FPGA development with a focus on skills relevant to high-frequency trading and low-latency systems.

## Background

Transitioning from 20+ years of C++ systems engineering and 5 years of active futures trading (S&P 500, Nasdaq) to understand hardware acceleration in trading infrastructure.

## Hardware

- Xilinx Arty A7-100T Development Board
- Artix-7 FPGA (XC7A100T-1CSG324C)
- AMD Vivado Design Suite

## Learning Path

Projects are designed to build from fundamentals toward trading-relevant skills:

- Clock management and timing constraints
- Synchronous design and metastability handling
- Serial communication protocols (UART, SPI)
- Data processing pipelines
- Hardware timestamping
- Clock domain crossing (CDC)
- FIFO buffers and flow control

## Projects

Each project includes:

- Complete VHDL/Verilog source code
- Comprehensive testbenches
- Simulation waveforms
- Constraint files (XDC)
- Hardware verification videos/photos
- Documentation of concepts learned

## Goals

1. Master FPGA development workflow (design → simulation → synthesis → hardware)
2. Build trading-relevant projects (market data parsing, order book, latency measurement)
3. Understand hardware acceleration advantages for low-latency systems
4. Create portfolio demonstrating full-stack engineering (software + hardware)

## Skills Demonstrated

- HDL design (VHDL/SystemVerilog)
- Testbench development and verification
- Waveform analysis and debugging
- Timing constraint management
- Protocol implementation
- State machine design
- Clock domain crossing
- Hardware/software integration
